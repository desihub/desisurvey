# Parameters used to schedule fiber assignment.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------

# Specify the cadence for updating fiber assignments. The choices are:
# - monthly: perform updates at every full moon break.
# - daily: perform updates as part of every afternoon plan.
fiber_assignment_cadence: monthly

# Specify the fiber-assignment ordering dependencies between passes.
# For example, "P2: P0+P1 delay 1" means that a tile in pass 2
# cannot be fiber assigned until all overlapping tiles in passes
# 0 and 1 have been completed. A delay value of 1 indicates
# that fiber assignment for pass 2 is delayed by 1 day / month
# (depending on fiber_assignment_cadence) after all overlapping
# tiles have been completed, to allow sufficient time to
# analyze offline outputs and confirm targeting decisions.
# Similarly, a delay of 0 indicates that fibers are assigned on
# the first day / month after the covering tiles are completed.
fiber_assignment_order:
    P999: P998 delay 1


# Nominal tile radius for determining whether two tiles overlap.

# Parameters to locate files needed by desisurvey.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------

# Name of file defining DESI tiles for desimodel.io.load_tiles(tiles_file).
# Without path this will look in $DESIMODEL/data/footprint/; otherwise with
# a path (relative or absolute) it will read that file.
# Non-standard tiles files are supported with the following caveats:
# - The program names (DARK,GRAY,BRIGHT) are predefined but not all
#   programs need to be included in the tiles file.
# - Pass numbers are arbitrary integers and do not need to be consecutive
#   or dense. However use of non-standard values will generally require
#   an update to fiber_assignment_order, above.
tiles_file: SV0_612tiles_March2020_uniquepassprogram.fits

commissioning: True
# tile file is a commissioning tile file. This disables checks related
# to PROGRAM, etc.

# Base path to pre-pended to all non-absolute paths used for reading and
# writing files managed by this package. The pattern {...} will be expanded
# using environment variables.
